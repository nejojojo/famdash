# Implementation & Testing Plan: Family Health Dashboard

## Quick Reference
**PRP Status:** ✅ Approved  
**Total Tasks:** 10 tasks across 4 conversation batches
**Estimated Timeline:** 4 conversations over 2-3 sessions

## Conversation Batching Strategy
**CRITICAL: Keep batches small to manage context window**
Based on the PRP complexity, create 4 conversation batches:
- **Batch 1:** Foundation (2 micro-tasks: Project setup, basic structure)
- **Batch 2:** Backend Core (3 micro-tasks: Server setup, Google Fit integration, data handling)
- **Batch 3:** Frontend & Integration (3 micro-tasks: Dashboard UI, API connection, real-time updates)
- **Batch 4:** Monitoring & Alerts (2 micro-tasks: Threshold checking, email notifications)

**Each batch = One conversation session**

## Implementation Guidelines

### Task Breakdown Rules:
- **Maximum 10-15 lines of code per task** (smaller is better for context)
- **2-3 tasks per batch maximum** (keeps conversation focused)
- Each task independently testable
- Clear file/function targets
- No task dependencies within same batch
- Every task must have specific manual test steps

### Testing Philosophy:
- **Test after EVERY task, not just at batch end**
- Manual verification with specific commands/actions
- No automated testing in skeleton phase
- Focus on observable behavior
- User-facing functionality over internals
- If a test fails, STOP and fix before proceeding

### Conversation Management:
- Start fresh after 3-4 tasks
- Always provide PRP context
- Reference completed work
- Clear next steps

## Critical Reminders:
- Follow PRP specifications exactly
- Verbose, readable code (no clever shortcuts)
- Test after EVERY task
- Document any deviations from plan
